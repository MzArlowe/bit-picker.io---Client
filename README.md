# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Client

2-01-2022 - 2-10-2022 - For 10 days the client has been slow to get up and structure - current progress is now going faster now that the structure is put together. 

### `npm start`

2-10-2022 - Works with Server and displays on local Server but not Heroku just yet. Compiles with Errors

### `npm test`

2-10-2022 - Tests - Runs with errors. Missing code will be finished today. 
2-16-2022 - Configured the fetch to work and got some issues worked out with the server code. Repushed to Heroku.
2-17-2022 - Added and fixed code in updateBuild, added component code in bitIndex and updateBit is 'done'.
2-17-2022 - Coded my CreateBit, GetBit, and my UpdateBit.
